                  following criteria was met:
                  - the target file did not exist because the target site kept
                  denying it
                  - the target dir was 100% owned by you or empty
                  - the max file size for the job was more than 2000 times
                  larger than the attempted file

                  avoid overload, useful in some cases

r714 2016-09-25 - added section and exclusion support to the banned groups
                  field.
                  examples:

                  SECT1/GROUP - GROUP is banned in SECT1 but allowed in other
                  sections
                  !GROUP - only GROUP is allowed in all sections
                  !SECT1/GROUP - only GROUP is allowed in SECT1

                  the format is:
                  password idle site1,site2 seconds
                  this will make all connections login and idle for the given
                  number of seconds, or the default idle time for the site if no
                  number is given.
                  fixed so that viewing files works even if the site has
                  disconnected
r689 2016-07-02 - fixed some site blocking special cases
r688 2016-07-02 - added support for switching between block/allow source/target
                  sites selection in editsitescreen
                  removed priority feature, use block/allow sites selector
                  instead

r681 2016-05-07 - forgot to add space for the initialization vector in the
                  outdata buffer during encryption
r680 2016-05-07 - forgot to reduce the buffer size for encrypted data

r666 2016-04-30 - evil edition!

r656 2016-04-03 - fixed race condition in time functions

                  in a skiplisted subdir of that race
r627 2016-01-17 - dont rely on "latest race id" when going to the race status
                  screen after starting a race as it doesn't work properly when
                  appending to existing races
r626 2016-01-17 - fixed a crash when starting a prepared race with 's'. How the
                  hell did i miss this. :)
r625 2016-01-08 - improved ui drawing performance
r624 2016-01-08 - fixed a crash due to order dependencies on global static
                  variable initialization
r623 2016-01-07 - made rawdata/rawcommand screens display stuff nicely in 80x24
                  terminals by removing unnecessary elements depending on
                  terminal size
                  added a "full screen" function, bound to backslash. simply
                  toggles showing info bar + legend bar

                  restructured makefiles a bit
                  the backend is now completely independent of the ui and can be
                  built without it without modifying any code - just comment the
                  ui path line in Makefile.inc. It's quite useless without ui,
                  but the idea is that hooking up another ui should be a simple
                  matter of making a dir with a makefile that builds a static
                  library which inherits UIBase and creates an instance of the
                  inheriting class and then specify that dir as ui in
                  Makefile.inc - that's it. Plus the ui code, obviously.
r621 2016-01-05 - missed disengaging in one of the connectfail cases
r620 2016-01-05 - fixed a missed case of ftpconnect disconnect before deferred
                  delete
r619 2016-01-04 - fixed month offset bug for local file lists
r618 2016-01-04 - used a less expensive way to delete stuff that may be referred
                  in the work queue
                  improved catching of unexpected data
                  ftpconnect now uses the ftpconn data parser for figuring out
                  the welcome message
r617 2016-01-04 - Added support for multiple site addresses.
                  It will try the first address, if no response within a second
                  it will try the other ones as well. The one which responds
                  first will be moved to the first position in the list (and
                  used first in subsequent attempts).
r616 2016-01-03 - improved the event framework a bit, for i.e. supporting
                  multiple registered sockets in the same eventreceiver instance

                  connection of a local transfer
r609 2015-12-30 - fixed a freshly introduced bug with data disappearing on
                  socket close
r608 2015-12-29 - disabled support for the SEED cipher. glftpd selects SEED for
                  data transfers by default (and enforces server cipher
                  preference). SEED is uncommon and inefficient. Disabling it
                  results in using AES-based ciphers instead.
r607 2015-12-29 - oh look, bad code :)
r606 2015-12-29 - some io improvements
r605 2015-12-27 - added support for using * as site list for race/prepare udp

r602 2015-12-19 - moved stuff away from globalcontext by encapsulating ssl init,
                  time functions, and threading in their own wrapper files
r601 2015-12-19 - added a race reset feature in the race status screen
r600 2015-12-13 - fixed a crash due to lingering delayed commands when adding
                  transfer jobs
r599 2015-11-29 - rawdatascreen + rawcommandscreen now display cp437 art
                  properly
r598 2015-11-28 - fixed some clang warnings
r597 2015-11-22 - fixed a crash when starting an fxp transfer job with the same
                  site as src/dst and only 1 slot is connected

                  command when the site string includes already added sites

                  press s or enter on a specific prepared race in the main
                  screen to start it, or press p from anywhere in the
                  application to start the latest prepared race
                  the udp format is otherwise the same as for regular races:
                  password prepare section release site1,site2,site3
r593 2015-11-07 - fixed a rare crash when starting a transferjob/race while a
                  related connection was waiting to reconnect due to previous
                  site full
r592 2015-11-01 - moved settings load/save away from main classes into a
                  separate SettingsLoaderSaver
                  settings are now saved to file on site modifications and every
